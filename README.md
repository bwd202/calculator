# calculator

BUGS

- keep percent from repeating too many times
- possible screen overflow with 9 digit numbers
- pressing 'plus-minus' during number 2 results in wrong math
- 0 divided by 0 gives NaN
- 0 repeats
- leading 0
- adding decimals can give unrounded number (e.g. 2.3 + 0.3 gives 2.5999999 instead of 2.6)

FEATURE SUGGESTIONS

- symbol for division
- keyboard functionality (extra credit)
- separating commas
- backspace button
- display 0 in front of period for decimals
- add more padding to the right of screen to make long numbers look better
