BUGS

- keep percent from repeating too many times
- 0 divided by 0 gives NaN
- 0 repeats / leading 0
- adding decimals can give unrounded number (e.g. 2.3 + 0.3 gives 2.5999999 instead of 2.6)

FEATURE SUGGESTIONS

- symbol for division
- keyboard functionality (extra credit)
- separating commas
- backspace button
- add more padding to the right of screen to make long numbers look better
- holding down a number repeats it
